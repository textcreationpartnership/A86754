            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:166549:3"/>to time, in the three Nations of England, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and Ireland, although one trouble succeeded another, occasioned by the several Warres and Commotions therein, in all which the Lord of Hoasts crowning Your endeavours with most hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py success, hath given a large interest in the hearts of the godly and well-affected of this Nation, who continually wrestled with God in prayer on your behalf, while your were jeoparding your lives for our Liberties in the high places of the Field. We therefore humbly conceive our selves bound in duty, from that zeal we bear to the Religious Laws Liberties and setled Peace of our Native Country, which we have cordially prayed, fought and acted for, and very principally also, out of that tenderest affection and most sincere respect we bear your Fxcellency and the Armies under your Conduct, to represent to You and them, the sad condition of this Nation, which seemeth as in one day, to be deprived of its ancient Liberty, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p>They being governed by Representatives cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen by themselves, which in all ages since England hath been civilized, the People have so constantly been addicted to, as that notwithstanding the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious change of the Kings, and the exercise of their Kingly power even when they have atchieved it by
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:166549:3"/>Conquest, there hath ever been found a necessity of governing the Nation by Parliament.</p>
            <p>Hereupon we cannot but hope, and do believe it is the earnest desire of thousands well affected in this City, that so ancient and usefull a Priviledge the birth-right of this Nation, will be as tenderly preserved in your Councels, as it hath been reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely maintained in your blouds.</p>
            <p>May it therefore seem good in your eyes, that some effectual means may be found out and persued, for the meeting of the Parliament a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; That so in some short time, provision may be made for setling successive Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives, which may carry on with effect and assurance those great Ends the Parliament hath continually held out, and Yee valiantly fought for; And to make provision for sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of the Armies and Navie, and other pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and pressing affairs in the mean time, as hitherto hath been done. It would be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving to the sad and doubtful thoughts of those that have fervently prayed, and do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually look up and wait for such a settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Liberties, as may assure us that our prayers and your endeavours have not been vain in the Lord.</p>
